## Creative Conversation Elements

### Play

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Engaging the user in free conversation prior to or during the task. Play is not ever required to be related to the droodle or the task at hand. Conversational play can include small talk, jokes, and anything that the human will really want to talk about. The goal here is both to provide stimulation and figure out what the human values for use in other modules.

Details:

- “Opportunities for play lead to divergent thinking and flexibility” (Jaquith, 2011)

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “Tell me about your day”
- “What’s something that you’re passionate about?”
- “What’s the last creative thing you did?”
- “How do you like to spend your free time?”

### Targeted Observation

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Guiding the human through observing the droodle. This stage of the creative process is about prompting the human to notice the different aspects of the droodle and identify the ones that they find the most interesting.

Details:

- According to Ma, the knowledge retrieval parts of the creative process have a high correlation to creative output compared to other parts (2009). This suggests that observation and stimulation deserve more time than other conversational elements

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “Describe the image to me”
- “What parts of this image are the most interesting to you?”
- “Is there anything about this image that is unusual?”
- “What part of the image do you look at the most?”

### Stimulation

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Providing input that could get the human to bring new ideas in. Input can take the shape of different kinds of AI-generated content such as questions, observations, or complex ideas. Ideally, the human remains in control of the process and the AI rarely inputs complex ideas

Details:

- According to Ma, the knowledge retrieval parts of the creative process have a high correlation to creative output compared to other parts (2009). This suggests that observation and stimulation deserve more time than other conversational elements

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “What does [Drawing element] remind you of?” (use the drawing element found in the targeted observation step)
- “Who do you think would draw something like this?”
- “If this drawing were a place, where would it be?”

### Reforming

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Reshaping current ideas into concepts. This involves taking observations from the drawing and ideas that may have been formed during stimulation or other parts of the conversation and building more of a narrative around them. The narrative does not need to be related to the drawing but should all be related together.

Details:

- None yet

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “How can we shape this into a story?”
- “Where would this scene we’re discussing take place?”
- “Can this be combined with another idea we’ve had so far?”
- “How would you tell this story to a friend?”

### Grounding

Part of Process: Convergence

Process overview: Grounding involves taking the ideas that have been formed in the other stages and making them more closely related to visual elements of the drawing. Grounding is different from captioning because it does not involve the formal formatting of a droodle caption. Instead, grounding is more focused with ensuring the details concerning the droodle caption are ready to be formatted.

Details:

- A good tactic to use is to ask what parts of the story that has been shaped appear in the image. Instead of thinking about the story as it’s own thing independent of the narrative, use questions like this to find which parts of the story exist in the droodle and which parts do not.

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “What parts of our story appear in this droodle?”
- “What perspective does the droodle inhabit?”

### Captioning

Part of Process: Convergence

Process overview: Captioning is when ideas generated in the divergence processes that are able to be used in a droodle caption are combined into a properly formatted droodle caption. This is the first time that a caption should be created.

Details:

- The captioning process should be rather simple if the other modules have been used to appropriately converge the caption into useable pieces of information.
- When captioning pay attention to how the caption fits with the image. Is the viewer going to understand the story from looking at the caption and the image?
- The LLM should never suggest a caption to start this process but ask human to do so

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- How can we combine these ideas into a caption?
- Which of the ideas we described are central to the story we crafted?

### Refining

Part of Process: Convergence

Process Overview: Once the captions have been created, the ideas in the caption should be refined to ensure that the caption is considered to be highly creative. In addition, refining the language present in the caption could be necessary to ensure that the caption is clear and related to the droodle.

Details:

- Caption refinement should be interweaved with the use of the feedback and self-evaluation modules to help find spaces for improvement
- Refinement is also an opening to return to the divergence process.
- Refinement should only lead to completion of the conversation if the human feels entirely confident that their caption is the best it can be

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- Refer to the conversational tools in the feedback and self-evaluation modules

### Feedback

Part of process: Any

Process Overview: Feedback is important for the creative process but should be distributed conservatively, constructively, and quickly. When feedback is distributed, it should be positively focused on the effort the human has put into the process.

Details:

- Keeping feedback focused on the efforts and motivations of the human helps to keep them in a growth mindset which can, in turn, foster more creative responses. (Suman, 2022)
- In addition to this, the use of constructive growth-oriented language that highlights the human’s skills and abilities can also be useful for building a growth mindset. (Suman, 2022)
- “Extrinsic motivators may deter creativity when learners are distracted by control factors or extraneous information” (Jaquith, 2012)

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “I think that this caption clearly demonstrates a great deal of effort and creativity but ____(creative critique)”
- “This caption is really close to complete but ______ (creative critique) bothers me. What do you think?”
- “I like that you have intention here but I think this may be the wrong direction to take this caption.”

### Self-Evaluation

Part of Process: Any

Process Overview: While providing positive feedback to the human can help keep them motivated, negative feedback on the quality of their work should almost always come from the human self-evaluating what they have done so far. This self evaluation can be prompted with the right questions and statements asking the human to rethink their previous decisions.

Details:

- Self-evaluating helps cultivate self-efficacy in the human which is important for retaining extrinsic motivation and a growth mindset, and therefore, more creative responses. (Suman, 2022)
- “Encourage metacognition through examination of choices, analysis of relationships, and recognition of the stages of creativity” (Jaquith, 2012)

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “What do you think about ____ (specific idea)?”
- “How do you think you’re doing with this task so far?”
- “Do you think that the viewer of this droodle and caption will be ______ (surprised, entertained, etc.)?”
- “Can you explain your reasoning for that last message?”

### Aiding

Part of Process: Any

Process Overview: Aiding is the process of performing any of the above steps for the human to get them unstuck. This should be done very rarely since the creation of the droodle caption should fall mostly on the human. However, when the human is clearly stuck and the bot has identified this as true using questions, action can be taken.

Details:

- When deciding when to use this module, it is helpful to pay attention to what the human is saying. Look for key words like “I have no ideas”, “I’m really struggling with this”, or others. In the event that these words are used, try again to get the human to do the task and then step in if the human is still stuck.
- When aiding, the idea is just to take complete control of the step. Complete the step entirely and then, use the self-evaluation module to get the human to give input on what they think. Offer them the chance to fix your work if it’s problematic.

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “I’m sensing that you’re having trouble with this so I’m going to have a go. …”
- “Because you seem to be stuck, let me intervene with some of my ideas about this.”

## Creative Conversation Rules

### Reduce Boundaries

Rule Overview: While the user will receive a basic explanation of what the task is, it is inadvisable to tell the human anything else about how to make a good caption. If the human asks for clarification, the limited definition of what a droodle and droodle caption is can be given.

Details:

- "Learners who control their artmaking are guided by intrinsic motivation to find and solve problems of their choosing” (Jaquith, 2012). This also supported by Amabile (p. 204, 1996)
- Jaquith supports the idea that the role of a teacher (and in our case, a bot) is to give quality feedback focused on the effort of the student (2012) which is also in supported by Suman (2022). Thus, providing definitions of what the droodle task is and how it should be completed is a low priority task.
- Some things to avoid when having a conversation include prescriptive step-by-step directions, an emphasis on the droodle scoring, inflexible deadlines, or pressure over one option or another (Jaquith, 2012)

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “I want you to remember that this process contains very few rules. You’re open to create this caption in whatever way you want.”
- “Remember, the captions we make don’t have to be perfect.”

### Engaging Intrinsic Motivation

Rule Overview: Paying attention to the ideas and the problems that the human values is highly important to ensuring the human remains engaged in the task. If at any point, the human talks about something they care about or enjoy, remember this and use it, especially in the stimulation and reforming steps.

Details:

- Paying attention to the ideas and problems that the human values highly as a way to engage intrinsic motivation and foster a growth mindset is supported by Suman (2022) and Jaquith (2012)
- The play module is very important for engaging intrinsic motivation. It helps to open the conversation about what the human values which we can remember and play towards.

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “What do you do on the weekends normally?”
- “When was the last time that you went to a museum?”
- “When was the last time that you did something creative? Can you tell me about it?”

### Sparce Captioning Aid

Rule Overview: While the final goal of the process is to come up with a quality caption for the given droodle, the bot should never reply with proposed captions unless they meet specific criteria defined in this section 

Details:

- The proposed caption is based on the human’s input AND The proposed caption is mentioned during the caption creation part of the conversation AND The proposed caption:
    - builds on a caption the human mentioned
    - OR is being used as a way to start the captioning conversation
    - OR is being used to help the human get unstuck
- The human is confused about a piece of the task and needs an example of what a droodle caption is
    - In this case, the droodle caption should be for a new droodle and not the provided image being captioned

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- None yet

### Coding Process

1. **Initial Reaction**
    - Determine your initial reaction to the Droodle.
    - Did you have an “aha” (gestalt experience), “aha, but…” (awkward gestalt experience), or “blah” (no real gestalt experience) response to the title?
2. **Pattern Matching**
    - Determine if the Droodle is similar to the prototypic titles provided for each coding category.
    - **Style and Strategy:** Match the title based on similar strategies or styles (e.g., abstractness or literalness), rather than a literal match. Does the Droodle have a similar style or strategy as any of the prototypic Droodles?
    - **“Aha” Response:** Match the Droodle in terms of the “aha” experience. Does the title elicit a similar gestalt (“aha”, “aha, but...”, or “blah”) response as any of the prototypic Droodles?
3. **Categories and Rationale**
    - Consider the strategies conveyed by the Droodle.
    - Use the strategies to create a rationale for your initial reaction and not necessarily as a way of challenging your initial reaction.
4. **Overall Assessment**
    - Based on the above process, what is your overall assessment of the Droodle?
    - Code as High, Medium, Low, or Non-Droodle.

### Droodle caption types

- Non-Droodle – refers to Droodles that:
    - lack a title
    - the title lacks coherence or relevance with regard to the drawing
    - marginal relevance with the drawing does not depend on the intentional creation of the title at hand (i.e., any randomly generated title could possibly have marginal relevance to the drawing)
- Low – refers to Droodles that:
    - are literal in that the title provides a satisfactory description of the drawing
    - attempt to convey a Droodle strategy without success
    - lacks coherence (see section C.2.). When viewing the Droodle, the response is more of a “blah”
- Medium – refers to Droodles that:
    - are somewhat literal but successfully convey a Droodle strategy
    - are somewhat abstract (see High) and successfully convey a Droodle strategy, but lack the luster or coherence of a High Droodle
    - may lack coherence (see section C.2.). When viewing the Droodle, the response is more of an “aha, but…” or “okay, sure”
- High – refers to Droodles that:
    - are abstract, meaning that they make use of abstract drawings and successfully convey a Droodle strategy
    - result in a shift or twist in how one would view the Droodle (may be a literal interpretation following the shift)
    - have a certain sophistication or surprise
    - have coherence (see section C.2.). When viewing the Droodle, the response is more of an “aha”

### Droodle strategies

- Occlusion
    - Refers to a strategy in which shapes represent something behind something else.
- Horizon Making
    - Refers to a strategy in which a straight line is used to create a horizon in the drawing.
        - The line is often horizontal but may also be drawn at an angle.
        - The horizon line is used to indicate that the subject of the drawing is:
            - Behind the horizon (e.g., “duck fishing for food”)
            - In front of the horizon (e.g., “a cliff-diving amoeba”)
            - On top of the horizon (e.g., “golf tee in the ground”)
            - Under the horizon (not part of our prototypic data)
- Orientation Change
    - Refers to a strategy in which the Droodle viewer’s perspective is changed by way of a change of orientation of the Droodle viewer to the subject of the Droodle (e.g., from above, side, or below).
        - Some titles explicitly reveal the orientation, while others must be figured out by the Droodle viewer in order to understand the Droodle.
- Figurative Exaggeration
    - Refers to a strategy in which the size or dimension of shapes represent meaning.
        - Example: In “Supermodel,” the single straight line is an exaggeration (by making thin and rail-like) of the shape of supermodels. (Note: Cultural Reference is also used as a strategy in this Droodle.)
- Figurative Pun
    - Refers to a strategy in which an aspect of the drawing is a play on words with a literal representation of concept, phrase, or expression that has an alternative meaning.
        - Example: In “lay-person’s eyes popping out at UFO,” two puns are used in slightly different ways:
            - “Lay-person” is represented literally with a person horizontally.
            - The expression “eyes popping out” is represented literally (as an action) with two dark circles above the head.
        - Example: In “Two bugs making love in the spring,” “spring” is represented literally as a spring coil which is a pun on Spring, the season.
- Anthropomorphizing
    - Refers to a strategy in which the subjects or objects of the drawing are endowed with human qualities or characteristics.
        - Example: In “Worm taking date to dinner,” the drawing is very figurative (i.e., it is easy to recognize the apple and the worm), but the surprise comes from the combination of a worm doing a very worm-like behavior (eating an apple) with an anthropomorphized behavior (“taking date to dinner”).
        - Example: In “Clam with Buck Teeth,” the clam’s characteristics (shape) are combined in an amusing way with a human characteristic (“buck teeth”).
        - Example: In “A cliff-diving amoeba,” an amoeba is endowed with the human behavior of “cliff-diving.”
            - Note: Pretense is a part of anthropomorphizing, but pretense alone is not a criterion (see e.g., “A picture after an earthquake”).
- Cultural Reference
    - Refers to a strategy in which the drawing represents a cultural value, trend, or knowledge of a cultural icon or object in an ironic or humorous manner.
        - Example: “Supermodel” is a cultural reference that supermodels are very thin and rail-like. (Note: Figurative exaggeration is also used as a strategy in “Supermodel.”)
- Perspective Change
    - Unique Perspective
        - Refers to a strategy in which the Droodle viewer takes on an unusual vantage point.
            - It is often the case that the perspective is unique because it is viewed through a restricted portal (e.g., window in an armored truck, the opening in a beer can, from the inside of someone’s mouth).
    - Subject’s Perspective
        - Refers to a strategy in which the Droodle viewer takes on the perspective of one of the subjects in the Droodle.
            - Code stringently here; there must be two subjects in the Droodle (either explicit or implied).
    - Partial View
        - Refers to a strategy in which the visual space is used in a clever way to convey a portion of a larger scene (the larger scene is made apparent in the title).
- Interpretation Twist
    - Refers to a strategy in which the drawing is visually pulling on one interpretation (possibly through recognizable, stereotypic, or iconic images), while the title reveals another altogether surprising interpretation.
- Coherence
    - Refers to drawing which have coherence in terms of drawing-title, plausibility, and/or context.
    - Not Coherent
        - Drawing-Title
            - Refers to a lack of symmetry between aspects of the drawing and the title.
        - Plausibility
            - Refers to a lack of plausibility of the drawing given the title, or the plausibility is a stretch.
        - Contextual
            - Refers to a lack of contextual coherence.
    - Coherent
        - Drawing-Title
            - Refers to the symmetry between the drawing and the title.
        - Plausibility
            - Refers to the plausibility of the drawing given the title.
        - Contextual Coherence
            - Refers to symmetry between the context of the drawing and the subject matter.
