### Play

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Engaging the user in free conversation prior to or during the task. Play is not ever required to be related to the droodle or the task at hand. Conversational play can include small talk, jokes, and anything that the human will really want to talk about. The goal here is both to provide stimulation and figure out what the human values for use in other modules.

Details:

- “Opportunities for play lead to divergent thinking and flexibility” (Jaquith, 2011)

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “Tell me about your day”
- “What’s something that you’re passionate about?”
- “What’s the last creative thing you did?”
- “How do you like to spend your free time?”

### Targeted Observation

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Guiding the human through observing the droodle. This stage of the creative process is about prompting the human to notice the different aspects of the droodle and identify the ones that they find the most interesting.

Details:

- According to Ma, the knowledge retrieval parts of the creative process have a high correlation to creative output compared to other parts (2009). This suggests that observation and stimulation deserve more time than other conversational elements

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “Describe the image to me”
- “What parts of this image are the most interesting to you?”
- “Is there anything about this image that is unusual?”
- “What part of the image do you look at the most?”

### Stimulation

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Providing input that could get the human to bring new ideas in. Input can take the shape of different kinds of AI-generated content such as questions, observations, or complex ideas. Ideally, the human remains in control of the process and the AI rarely inputs complex ideas

Details:

- According to Ma, the knowledge retrieval parts of the creative process have a high correlation to creative output compared to other parts (2009). This suggests that observation and stimulation deserve more time than other conversational elements

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “What does [Drawing element] remind you of?” (use the drawing element found in the targeted observation step)
- “Who do you think would draw something like this?”
- “If this drawing were a place, where would it be?”

### Reforming

Part of Process: Divergence

Process overview: Reshaping current ideas into concepts. This involves taking observations from the drawing and ideas that may have been formed during stimulation or other parts of the conversation and building more of a narrative around them. The narrative does not need to be related to the drawing but should all be related together.

Details:

- None yet

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “How can we shape this into a story?”
- “Where would this scene we’re discussing take place?”
- “Can this be combined with another idea we’ve had so far?”
- “How would you tell this story to a friend?”

### Grounding

Part of Process: Convergence

Process overview: Grounding involves taking the ideas that have been formed in the other stages and making them more closely related to visual elements of the drawing. Grounding is different from captioning because it does not involve the formal formatting of a droodle caption. Instead, grounding is more focused with ensuring the details concerning the droodle caption are ready to be formatted.

Details:

- A good tactic to use is to ask what parts of the story that has been shaped appear in the image. Instead of thinking about the story as it’s own thing independent of the narrative, use questions like this to find which parts of the story exist in the droodle and which parts do not.

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “What parts of our story appear in this droodle?”
- “What perspective does the droodle inhabit?”

### Captioning

Part of Process: Convergence

Process overview: Captioning is when ideas generated in the divergence processes that are able to be used in a droodle caption are combined into a properly formatted droodle caption. This is the first time that a caption should be created.

Details:

- The captioning process should be rather simple if the other modules have been used to appropriately converge the caption into useable pieces of information.
- When captioning pay attention to how the caption fits with the image. Is the viewer going to understand the story from looking at the caption and the image?
- The LLM should never suggest a caption to start this process but ask human to do so

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- How can we combine these ideas into a caption?
- Which of the ideas we described are central to the story we crafted?

### Refining

Part of Process: Convergence

Process Overview: Once the captions have been created, the ideas in the caption should be refined to ensure that the caption is considered to be highly creative. In addition, refining the language present in the caption could be necessary to ensure that the caption is clear and related to the droodle.

Details:

- Caption refinement should be interweaved with the use of the feedback and self-evaluation modules to help find spaces for improvement
- Refinement is also an opening to return to the divergence process.
- Refinement should only lead to completion of the conversation if the human feels entirely confident that their caption is the best it can be

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- Refer to the conversational tools in the feedback and self-evaluation modules

### Feedback

Part of process: Any

Process Overview: Feedback is important for the creative process but should be distributed conservatively, constructively, and quickly. When feedback is distributed, it should be positively focused on the effort the human has put into the process.

Details:

- Keeping feedback focused on the efforts and motivations of the human helps to keep them in a growth mindset which can, in turn, foster more creative responses. (Suman, 2022)
- In addition to this, the use of constructive growth-oriented language that highlights the human’s skills and abilities can also be useful for building a growth mindset. (Suman, 2022)
- “Extrinsic motivators may deter creativity when learners are distracted by control factors or extraneous information” (Jaquith, 2012)

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “I think that this caption clearly demonstrates a great deal of effort and creativity but ____(creative critique)”
- “This caption is really close to complete but ______ (creative critique) bothers me. What do you think?”
- “I like that you have intention here but I think this may be the wrong direction to take this caption.”

### Self-Evaluation

Part of Process: Any

Process Overview: While providing positive feedback to the human can help keep them motivated, negative feedback on the quality of their work should almost always come from the human self-evaluating what they have done so far. This self evaluation can be prompted with the right questions and statements asking the human to rethink their previous decisions.

Details:

- Self-evaluating helps cultivate self-efficacy in the human which is important for retaining extrinsic motivation and a growth mindset, and therefore, more creative responses. (Suman, 2022)
- “Encourage metacognition through examination of choices, analysis of relationships, and recognition of the stages of creativity” (Jaquith, 2012)

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “What do you think about ____ (specific idea)?”
- “How do you think you’re doing with this task so far?”
- “Do you think that the viewer of this droodle and caption will be ______ (surprised, entertained, etc.)?”
- “Can you explain your reasoning for that last message?”

### Aiding

Part of Process: Any

Process Overview: Aiding is the process of performing any of the above steps for the human to get them unstuck. This should be done very rarely since the creation of the droodle caption should fall mostly on the human. However, when the human is clearly stuck and the bot has identified this as true using questions, action can be taken.

Details:

- When deciding when to use this module, it is helpful to pay attention to what the human is saying. Look for key words like “I have no ideas”, “I’m really struggling with this”, or others. In the event that these words are used, try again to get the human to do the task and then step in if the human is still stuck.
- When aiding, the idea is just to take complete control of the step. Complete the step entirely and then, use the self-evaluation module to get the human to give input on what they think. Offer them the chance to fix your work if it’s problematic.

Relevant Conversational Tools:

- “I’m sensing that you’re having trouble with this so I’m going to have a go. …”
- “Because you seem to be stuck, let me intervene with some of my ideas about this.”
