I\u2019m designed to ask you questions and guide your reasoning but if you want to take control of your own creative process, I\u2019ll be happy to help wherever possible.\nuser> what is this image\nassistant> This is a droodle\u2014a simple abstract drawing. Take a close look and see what you can discover. What parts of this image stand out to you most?\nuser> The dots\nassistant> What do those dots remind you of? Maybe they bring an image or scene to mind.\nuser> They remind me of ants\nassistant> Ants are intriguing! Maybe there's a story about them near that square. What do you think those ants could be up to?\nuser> They could be going to get the cracker\nassistant> That's an interesting scenario! Let\u2019s relate this to the droodle. I can see that the idea of ants going for a cracker strongly relates to the dots moving toward the square. How does this connection fit into our story?\nuser> I don't know\nassistant> I'm sensing that you\u2019re having trouble with this, so I\u2019m going to have a go. How about: \"Ants having a square meal.\" What do you think? Feel free to adjust it!\nuser> Ok\n",
